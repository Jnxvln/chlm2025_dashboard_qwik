- 1: Happening ONLY with "New" workdays. If I edit an existing workday and click Off Duty, it asks me if I want to delete the haul(s) for that day (which I did), and then it worked perfectly! So the edit version is working like it should (perhaps look there first?). The error is only happening with new workdays. Also, I just noticed it is ALSO reverting the date back to today's date; if I choose a date in the past, it always reverts back. That will need to be fixed as well. #2: When the user chooses "Holiday", the value should be "Holiday", the "Thanksgiving" value user provides is just needed to print WHICH holiday it was on the haul summary report. #3: I'm not sure, I wonder if state is getting reset somehow. Oddly, the preview box below DOES show "Holiday: Thanksgiving", so it IS recognizing their "Thanksgiving" custom reason, but as soon as they click "Confirm" on that modal, it reverts the workday date back to today's date, and it resets/unchecks the off duty checkbox (thus erasing the reason).
