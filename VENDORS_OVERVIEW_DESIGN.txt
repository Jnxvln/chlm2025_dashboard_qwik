VENDORS OVERVIEW DESIGN

I would like to add a new route for "/vendors/overview".

As it currently stands, "/vendors" shows us the vendors listing table,
and a set of links to each corresponding model (Locations, Products, Freight Routes).
When my employer asks "what's the product cost of __?" or "What's the freight on __?", 
or "which vendor is __ product from?", etc., I have to navigate between all 4 of these 
tabs to view information (and possibly edit).

I want to keep all that, however at "/vendors/overview" I would like to aggregate all that 
information into one dynamic interface. It should include a search feature to search by vendor name, 
product name, or freight route destination name (additionally, since we added `toYard`, maybe 
a feature to list all `toYard` products?). I want some kind of layout that allows us to 
see/find/edit all relevant information in a single unified interface, without having to switch 
tabs. Also, since there will be a ton of freight routes over time, it would be nice if when the 
user clicks on a vendor product, it automatically highlights the "toYard" freight route by 
default, just so we can quickly see the "C&H Yard" freightCost since we readily need that bit 
of information.

I don't have any design notes as I've never created this page/interface before, even in the 
old system. Just use your reasoning abilities to determine the maximum-effect, maximum-efficiency 
layout using signals and data, easy enough for someone not computer-literate to find their way 
around; intuitive.

I actually really like the row expansion feature you have on the Workday table listing for 
the haul system at "/hauls". Maybe we could include that feature here as well, showing a clear
hierarchy? I'll leave that decision to you though.
